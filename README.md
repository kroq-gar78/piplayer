piplayer
========

By associating each base-10 digit to a tone, this Java program "plays" the irrational number pi. The program `PiCalculator` calculates and save pi to a file, and `PiPlayer` reads the digits from the file.

The `master` branch uses base 10 to play pi. Use the `base12` branch to calculate and play pi in base 12.
